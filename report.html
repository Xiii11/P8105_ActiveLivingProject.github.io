<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>
<p>According to the <a
href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2023/2023-06-20_obesity.htm">New
York State Department of Health</a>, approximately two-thirds of adult
New Yorkers have a Body Mass Index (BMI) classified as either obese
(29.1%) or overweight (34.5%), impacting over 8.4 million adults across
New York State. Additionally, the <a
href="https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/nyc-greenhouse-gas-inventories/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">NYC
Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice</a> reports that
transportation accounts for approximately 30% of the city’s greenhouse
gas emissions. By examining the impact of active design on physical
activity and transportation, this project aims to provide insights that
can inform policies to improve public health and reduce environmental
impact in New York City.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Related Work</strong></h1>
<p>One of our group members is doing her internship on a street safety
program in Brooklyn. When she was doing literature review she found out
that research shows well-designed urban areas with pedestrian-friendly
streets and mixed-use spaces encourage people to walk more and drive
less, which can help reduce obesity rates. This active design also
lowers city pollution by cutting down on car use, aiding environmental
efforts against climate change. Cities like New York are incorporating
these principles into their urban planning policies to promote healthier
lifestyles and environmental sustainability. Studies support the idea
that features such as accessible stairs, attractive walking paths, and
bike lanes not only make physical activity more appealing but are
effective in transforming urban areas into healthier, greener spaces. We
were inspired from those findings and would like to know more in the
relationship between sidewalk areas and people’s choice on commuting
ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Initial Questions</strong></h1>
<p>We were interested in exploring the availability of sidewalk areas
and the percentage of walking among commuters influence obesity rates
across different boroughs and neighborhoods. The purposes of this
project is to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the most popular commuting methods in different
boroughs?<br />
</li>
<li>Which area (by borough) has the highest obesity rate?<br />
</li>
<li>What is the association between sidewalk areas and the percentage of
walking among commuters by boroughs?<br />
</li>
<li>How does the availability of sidewalk areas and the percentage of
walking among commuters influence obesity rates across different
boroughs?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="data-sources-and-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Data Sources and Cleaning</strong></h1>
<p>Due to the limitations of the variables and information within the
dataset, the data cleaning process was conducted independently for each
analysis part.</p>
<div id="part-1." class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1.</h2>
<p>Firstly, we processed both
<code>neighborhood- and borough-level</code> commuting data, focusing on
four commuting methods: bicycle, car/truck/van, public transportation,
and walking. These methods are represented in terms of both absolute
numbers and percentages. We clean the dataset by removing unnecessary
columns, renaming variables for clarity (e.g., <code>geography</code>
renamed to <code>neighborhood</code> and <code>borough</code>
accordingly based on analysis needs), and converting numeric data from
character format to ensure proper analysis.</p>
<p>Next, we pivot the data into a long format, enabling a flexible
structure for analysis and visualization by method and borough. The
dataset is sorted by <code>geo_id</code> for a consistent ordering of
boroughs. This preparation provides a clean and organized dataset that
supports further exploratory analysis of commuting patterns and their
relationships to sidewalk and obesity factors.</p>
<p>The final dataset <code>commuting_data</code> showed below.</p>

<p>We proceed to import our data using both read.csv() and read_csv()
from the readr package, specifying NA values to accurately handle
missing data right from the start. We then standardize column names to a
uniform format with janitor::clean_names() function, which simplifies
further coding and analysis. Moreover,we also transform the data by
converting numeric fields from string format to actual numbers, removing
commas for accurate calculations, and filtering the dataset to include
only borough-level data</p>
<p>Similarly, for overweight &amp; obesity dataset, we first create a
bar chart using ggplot2 to display obesity rates and corresponding
numbers for each NYC borough, enhancing clarity with direct textual
annotations on the bars. To make the chart interactive and allow dynamic
exploration, we employ plotly, transforming the static ggplot into an
interactive visualization. Additionally, we develop a trend line plot to
illustrate changes in obesity rates over the years across boroughs. This
line plot, also made interactive with plotly, includes tooltips that
provide detailed data insights when users hover over any point, thus
enabling a deeper understanding of obesity trends within each
borough.</p>

<p>To understand the association between obesity rates in different
areas, urban design (Sidewalk Coverage), and various commuting methods,
we included the following key variables in our analysis:</p>
<p>The major outcome variable in this analysis is obesity rate, which
represents the estimated proportion of adults classified as overweight
or obese. It is calculated using two metrics: first, the absolute number
of individuals, rounded to the nearest 1,000, who fall into specific <a
href="https://www.worldobesity.org/about/about-obesity/obesity-classification#:~:text=BMI%20is%20calculated%20as%20weight,30%20kg%2Fm%C2%B2%20defines%20obesity.">BMI
categories</a> (overweight: BMI 25–29.9; obese: BMI ≥30); second, the
percentage of the total population meeting these BMI thresholds.</p>
<p>The obesity rate demonstrates variability across regions. Below is a
summary of key descriptive statistics:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate summary statistics for obesity percentage
obesity_table = overweight_overall_df |&gt; 
  summarize(
    overall_mean = mean(as.numeric(obs_percent), na.rm = TRUE),
    overall_std = sd(as.numeric(obs_percent), na.rm = TRUE),
    min_value = min(as.numeric(obs_percent), na.rm = TRUE),
    max_value = max(as.numeric(obs_percent), na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |&gt; 
  rename(
    &quot;Mean&quot; = overall_mean,
    &quot;Std Dev&quot; = overall_std,
    &quot;Min&quot; = min_value,
    &quot;Max&quot; = max_value
  )

<p>The mean obesity rate across regions is 57.43%, with a standard
deviation of 9.47%, indicating moderate variability. The minimum
observed obesity rate is 30.1%, while the maximum is 78.7%. This
variation suggests disparities between regions, potentially influenced
by factors such as urban design, socioeconomic conditions, and access to
health resources. Areas with lower rates may benefit from better
infrastructure or healthier lifestyles, while regions with higher rates
may require targeted interventions to address obesity-related
challenges.</p>
<p>Our first explanatory variable, sidewalk area, is calculated as the
total curb-to-building sidewalk area (in square kilometers) within the
UHF neighborhood and borough, divided by the total land area (excluding
inland water bodies), and expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p>To explore how urban design affects health outcomes, we summarize
sidewalk area coverage percentages as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate summary statistics for sidewalk area percentage
sidewalk_table = sidewalk_df |&gt; 
  summarize(
    overall_mean = mean(percent_of_land_area, na.rm = TRUE),

    max_value = max(percent_of_land_area, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |&gt; 
  rename(
    &quot;Mean&quot; = overall_mean,

<p>Next, the second explanatory variable is commuting methods, which
provide insights into how adults travel to work, categorized by modes
such as public transit, biking, walking, or private vehicles. These
patterns help us understand transportation availability, individual
choices, traffic conditions, and safety concerns. The dataset includes
information on the estimated number and proportion of workers aged 16
and above using each commuting mode, including bicycling, driving (car,
truck, or van), public transportation, and walking.</p>
<p>Below are the summarized statistics for commuting methods:</p>

<p>The summary statistics for commuting methods reveal distinct trends
in how people travel to work. Public transportation emerges as the most
commonly used mode, with an average usage rate of 47.75%, followed by
cars at 28.86%. Walking and biking, though less frequent, still play
significant roles in some areas, with averages of 9.58% and 1.28%,
respectively. The observed variability across methods, particularly in
car and public transit usage, highlights differences in regional
infrastructure, accessibility, and commuting preferences. These insights
into commuting behaviors provide critical context for understanding
urban mobility and its potential impact on health outcomes.
Transitioning to the final explanatory variable, geographical data
allows us to examine these variables at both neighborhood and borough
levels, offering a nuanced understanding of how urban design and
commuting patterns intersect with health outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, the geographical variables in our analysis involve data
aggregated at both the neighborhood and borough levels.
Neighborhood-level data provides detailed insights into smaller,
localized areas, allowing us to examine specific community
characteristics. Borough-level data offers a broader regional
perspective, enabling comparisons across larger urban sections. This
dual-scale approach enhances our understanding of how urban design and
commuting patterns intersect with health outcomes like obesity rates,
offering a nuanced perspective on spatial variations within the
city.</p>
<p>Having outlined the essential variables, we delve deeper into
exploring the relationships between these variables. In the following
section, we perform Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns
and associations, such as how sidewalk coverage and commuting patterns
influence obesity rates and how these variables differ across
geographical levels.</p>

<p>We first explore the distribution of interested outcome variable,
Sidewalk Coverage, then explore the distributions of two exposure
variables and their relationship of Sidewalk Coverage.</p>
<p>The analysis begins by examining the distribution of sidewalk
coverage percentages across neighborhoods, as shown in the first bar
chart. Sidewalk coverage ranges from approximately 2.7% to 11.3%, with
the interquartile range (IQR) between 6.2% and 9.5%. The median value
sits at 7.65%. These findings highlight the significant variability in
sidewalk coverage across neighborhoods, which could have implications
for urban mobility, public health, and commuting behaviors.
Neighborhoods with higher sidewalk coverage may be better equipped to
promote walkability and active modes of transport, while areas with
lower coverage might rely more heavily on vehicular commuting.</p>

<p>The next step explores how commute modes—bicycle, walking,
car/truck/van, and public transportation—are distributed across
neighborhoods and how they relate to sidewalk coverage. The stacked bar
chart reveals that public transportation (represented in dark green) is
the predominant mode of commuting in most neighborhoods, while walking
(in thistle purple) and bicycling (light pink) are less common. This
disparity likely reflects the challenges of walkability and
infrastructure limitations in certain areas. Additionally, neighborhoods
with higher reliance on walking tend to have better sidewalk coverage,
emphasizing the role of urban design in facilitating sustainable
commuting practices.</p>

<p>The relationship between sidewalk coverage and public health,
particularly obesity percentages, is further analyzed. The line graph
tracks obesity trends from 2014 to 2022 across neighborhoods. While some
neighborhoods show consistently high obesity percentages (e.g., parts of
the Bronx and Staten Island), others like Manhattan demonstrate lower
percentages, reflecting potential benefits of high walkability and
robust transportation options. This trend underscores the potential of
urban infrastructure to influence health outcomes.</p>

<p>The scatterplot provides a more detailed view of the relationship
between sidewalk coverage and obesity percentages, focusing on 2014 and
2022. In 2014, the data indicates a weak correlation between the two
variables, as obesity percentages remain relatively uniform across
different levels of sidewalk coverage. However, by 2022, a stronger
negative trend emerges—neighborhoods with higher sidewalk coverage
exhibit noticeably lower obesity percentages. This shift may reflect the
growing impact of improved urban design, active commuting options, and
public health initiatives over time.</p>
<p>Outliers in both years highlight the complexity of these dynamics,
suggesting that other contextual factors, such as socioeconomic status
or access to healthy foods, may also play a role. The analysis
reinforces the importance of investing in walkable infrastructure as a
strategy to address public health disparities.</p>

<p>The neighborhood-level analysis underscores the critical influence of
sidewalk coverage and urban infrastructure on commuting behaviors and
health outcomes. Neighborhoods with higher sidewalk coverage demonstrate
a greater reliance on walking and public transportation, which can
contribute to more active lifestyles and reduced obesity rates.
Conversely, areas with lower sidewalk coverage tend to depend more on
car/truck commuting, possibly exacerbating sedentary behaviors and
associated health risks.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that targeted investments in improving
sidewalk infrastructure, particularly in neighborhoods with low
coverage, could promote walkability and encourage healthier commuting
patterns. However, the observed disparities highlight the need to
consider other contextual factors, such as socioeconomic status, urban
density, and accessibility to recreational spaces, to create equitable
and effective urban planning strategies. As we transition to a
borough-level perspective, we explore how these patterns aggregate and
vary across broader regions, providing additional insights into
geographic disparities and their implications for urban policy.</p>

<h2><em>Borough Level</em>:</h2>
<p>Firstly, we gain an initial understanding of the commuting patterns
across New York City’s boroughs by analyzing the distribution of various
commuting methods.A bar chart provides a clear visual representation of
the total amount of transportation modes used in each borough. A
percentage distribution bar chart is used to highlight the relative
popularity of each mode of transport within the boroughs.</p>

<p>Overall, the most prominent mode is public transportation. In
contrast, the use of bicycles is minimal across all boroughs, with
Staten Island reporting the lowest numbers. Walking as a commuting mode
demonstrates moderate levels, with Manhattan showing the highest
prevalence compared to other boroughs.</p>

<p>The presented dataset examines the percentage distribution of
commuting modes across New York City’s boroughs. The bar chart
highlights that public transportation is the most widely used commuting
mode in most boroughs, with over 50% of commuters relying on it in areas
like Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. In contrast, Staten Island
deviates from this trend, where cars, trucks, and vans dominate as the
primary commuting mode, accounting for the majority of transportation.
Walking also contributes notably in Manhattan, reflecting its dense
urban environment.</p>

<p>The above graph showcases the obesity rates and corresponding numbers
across various boroughs in NYC for the year 2022. The data is
represented by a bar chart, where each color-coded bar corresponds to a
different borough. The Bronx stands out with the highest obesity rate,
significantly surpassing the other boroughs, whereas Manhattan reports
the lowest rate, indicating a stark contrast in obesity prevalence
within the city. Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island exhibit moderate
obesity rates, illustrating varied health profiles across these
regions.</p>

<p>This graph shows the changes in obesity rates across New York City’s
boroughs from the early 2000s to 2022. Matching with what we had in last
graph, the Bronx has consistently high obesity rates, suggesting ongoing
health challenges there. Manhattan generally has the lowest rates,
possibly due to different lifestyle factors. Brooklyn, Queens, and
Staten Island show varied rates over the years, with ups and downs. We
will explore more on the relationship between obesity and other factors
in the model building part.</p>

influences the proportion of residents who commute by walking. By

analysis sets the stage for exploring more complex interactions.</p>

<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scatterplot Analysis</strong>: The scatterplot reveals a
positive relationship between sidewalk area percentage and walking
commuter rates, with a linear trend suggesting that as sidewalk coverage
increases, so does the percentage of walking commuters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regression Results</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slope coefficient (β₁ = 1.962) indicates that for every 1%
increase in sidewalk area, walking commuter rates are predicted to
increase by approximately 1.96 percentage points.</li>
<li>The intercept of −5.307 suggests negative predicted walking rates at
very low sidewalk percentages, indicating the model’s limitations at
extreme values.</li>
<li>The model explains 42.1% of the variance in walking commuter rates,
reflecting moderate predictive power.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These results highlight the substantial impact of sidewalk
infrastructure on walking behavior. Higher sidewalk area percentages are
strongly associated with increased walking commuter rates. However, the
unexplained variance suggests that other factors, such as neighborhood
characteristics or availability of public transit, may also influence
walking behavior.</p>

<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scatterplot Analysis</strong>: The scatterplot highlights
a negative association between obesity percentages and both predictors
(sidewalk area percentage and walking commuters), with stronger
relationships observed for walking commuters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regression Results</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sidewalk area slope suggests that for every 1% increase in
sidewalk area, obesity rates decrease by 0.631 percentage points.
However, this effect is not statistically significant at the
conventional 0.05 level.</li>
<li>The walking commuter slope indicates that for every 1% increase in
walking commuter rates, obesity rates decrease by 1.097 percentage
points. This effect is statistically significant.</li>
<li>The model explains 36.7% of the variance in obesity rates,
demonstrating moderate predictive power.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>While both sidewalk availability and walking commuter rates are
negatively associated with obesity rates, the walking commuter
percentage exhibits a stronger and statistically significant
relationship. This finding suggests that encouraging walking as a mode
of transport may directly impact obesity rates more effectively than
sidewalk infrastructure alone. However, the insignificant effect of
sidewalk coverage emphasizes the need to explore additional factors,
such as dietary patterns, socioeconomic status, and access to
recreational spaces, to better understand the determinants of
obesity.</p>
<p>The regression models highlight the critical relationships between
urban infrastructure, commuting behaviors, and public health outcomes.
Sidewalk area percentage was found to positively influence walking
commuter rates, which, in turn, had a significant negative association
with obesity percentages. These findings emphasize the importance of
walkable infrastructure in promoting active commuting and reducing
obesity rates, offering valuable insights for urban planning and public
health initiatives.</p>
<p>However, the analyses also revealed unexplained variance, suggesting
that other factors, such as social, economic, and environmental
influences, may play a role in shaping these outcomes. Building on these
findings, further exploration is needed to capture the complexities of
these relationships, including potential interactions and dynamic
influences across neighborhoods.</p>

<h2><strong>Interaction Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>An interaction model was constructed to determine if the relationship
between sidewalk area percentage and obesity rates depended on walking
commuter rates. The results showed no significant interaction effect (p
= 0.932), indicating that the effects of sidewalk area and walking
commuter rates on obesity operate independently. Neither sidewalk area
(p = 0.556) nor walking commuter rates (p = 0.317) had significant
direct effects on obesity rates in this model.</p>

<p>The results indicate that the interaction term
(percent_of_land_area:walked_percent) is not statistically significant
(p = 0.932), suggesting that the relationship between sidewalk area
percentage and obesity rates does not depend on walking commuter rates.
This implies that sidewalk area percentage and walking commuter rates
<strong>operate independently</strong> in influencing obesity
outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Visualizing Interaction Effects</strong> To better understand
the potential interaction, we created a plot that categorizes walking
commuter rates into four levels: Low, Moderate, High, and Very High.
Each category is represented by a distinct color, with regression lines
and shaded confidence intervals illustrating the relationship between
sidewalk area percentage and obesity rates for each category.</p>

<h4><strong>Results and Insights</strong></h4>
<p>The plot illustrates the interaction between sidewalk area percentage
and obesity rates across four categories of walking commuter rates.
Regression lines for each category are relatively flat and similar in
slope, indicating that the relationship between sidewalk area percentage
and obesity rates does not vary meaningfully with walking commuter
rates. The confidence intervals overlap substantially, reinforcing the
statistical finding of a non-significant interaction effect.</p>
<p>Together, the plot and the interaction analysis table confirm that
there is no significant interaction between sidewalk area percentage and
walking commuter rates on obesity rates. While walking commuter rates
and sidewalk area percentage may independently contribute to obesity
outcomes, their combined effect does not exhibit meaningful synergy.
Future research could investigate other potential mediators or
moderators, such as socioeconomic status or access to recreational
infrastructure, to better understand the determinants of obesity in
urban settings.</p>

<p>The mediation analysis demonstrates that walking commuter rates
<strong>significantly mediate</strong> the relationship between sidewalk
area percentage and obesity rates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Indirect Effect (ACME):</strong> A statistically
significant reduction in obesity rates of 0.91 units for every 1%
increase in sidewalk area, mediated by walking commuter rates (p &lt;
0.001).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Direct Effect (ADE):</strong> No statistically
significant direct effect of sidewalk area on obesity rates (-0.631, p =
0.124).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total Effect:</strong> A significant total reduction of
1.54 units in obesity rates for every 1% increase in sidewalk area (p
&lt; 0.001).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportion Mediated:</strong> Approximately 59% of the
total effect was mediated by walking behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings highlight the potential of urban planning strategies,
such as increasing sidewalk coverage, to promote walking and reduce
obesity rates. While sidewalk area alone may not directly reduce
obesity, its role in fostering environments that encourage active
commuting is pivotal. Policymakers should prioritize pedestrian-friendly
infrastructure alongside initiatives to promote walking, addressing
public health challenges like obesity while supporting broader urban
health goals.</p>

<div id="cluster-characteristics" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Cluster Characteristics</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cluster 1 (Green)</strong>: Includes neighborhoods with
<strong>low sidewalk area percentages</strong> and <strong>low walking
commuter percentages</strong>. These neighborhoods may lack sufficient
pedestrian infrastructure, which could contribute to higher obesity
rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster 2 (Orange)</strong>: Represents neighborhoods
with <strong>moderate sidewalk area percentages</strong> and
<strong>moderate walking commuter percentages</strong>. These areas show
some support for walkability but may require additional investment in
pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster 3 (Blue)</strong>: Comprises neighborhoods with
the <strong>highest sidewalk area percentages</strong> and
<strong>walking commuter percentages</strong>. These neighborhoods are
likely the most walkable and may experience lower obesity rates due to
increased active commuting.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="insights-from-the-plot" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Insights from the Plot</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Positive Trend Between Sidewalk Area and Walking
Rates</strong>: Neighborhoods with higher sidewalk area percentages tend
to exhibit higher walking commuter percentages, as seen in Cluster
3.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster Overlap</strong>: Some points from different
clusters overlap, suggesting that additional factors (e.g.,
socioeconomic conditions, safety) may influence walkability and health
outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Implications</strong>: The clustering highlights
the importance of investing in sidewalk infrastructure to promote
walking, which could improve public health outcomes like obesity
rates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The clusters provide actionable insights into neighborhood
characteristics. For example, neighborhoods in Cluster 1 would benefit
most from improved pedestrian infrastructure to encourage walking and
reduce obesity rates. Meanwhile, the characteristics of neighborhoods in
Cluster 3 demonstrate the positive outcomes of well-designed urban
spaces that support active commuting.</p>
</div>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>This project highlights the importance of urban active design, such
as the sidewalk infrastructure in promoting walking and improving public
health outcomes. Walking commuter rates are a critical pathway linking
sidewalk availability to reduced obesity rates, as shown by the
significant mediation effects. While sidewalk area alone does not
directly influence obesity rates, its ability to foster walking behavior
plays a pivotal role in reducing obesity.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Discussion</strong></h1>
<p>The findings emphasize the need for integrated urban planning
strategies that combine pedestrian-friendly infrastructure with
initiatives to encourage active commuting behaviors. Policymakers should
prioritize investments in sidewalk improvements, particularly in areas
with high obesity rates, such as the Bronx, to promote healthier
lifestyles. Future research could explore additional mediators, such as
access to recreational spaces or socioeconomic factors, to gain a deeper
understanding of how urban infrastructure influences health
outcomes.</p>
<p>This project provides actionable insights for urban planners and
policymakers aiming to reduce obesity rates through infrastructure and
behavior change interventions. By promoting walking as a commuting mode,
cities can achieve both public health and environmental sustainability
goals.</p>
