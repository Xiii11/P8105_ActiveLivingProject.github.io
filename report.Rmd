We were interested in exploring the availability of sidewalk areas and the percentage of walking among commuters influence obesity rates across different boroughs and neighborhoods.
The purposes of this project is to answer the following questions:

- What are the most popular commuting methods in different boroughs?  
- Which area (by borough) has the highest obesity rate?  
- What is the association between sidewalk areas and the percentage of walking among commuters by boroughs?  
- How does the availability of sidewalk areas and the percentage of walking among commuters influence obesity rates across different boroughs?

Due to the limitations of the variables and information within the dataset, the data cleaning process was conducted independently for each analysis part.
