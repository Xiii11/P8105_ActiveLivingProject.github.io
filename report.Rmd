# **Motivation**
According to the [New York State Department of Health](https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2023/2023-06-20_obesity.htm), approximately two-thirds of adult New Yorkers have a Body Mass Index (BMI) classified as either obese (29.1%) or overweight (34.5%), impacting over 8.4 million adults across New York State. Additionally, the [NYC Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice](https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/nyc-greenhouse-gas-inventories/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) reports that transportation accounts for approximately 30% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions. By examining the impact of active design on physical activity and transportation, this project aims to provide insights that can inform policies to improve public health and reduce environmental impact in New York City.

# **Related Work**
One of our group members is doing her internship on a street safety program in Brooklyn. When she was doing literature review she found out that research shows well-designed urban areas with pedestrian-friendly streets and mixed-use spaces encourage people to walk more and drive less, which can help reduce obesity rates. This active design also lowers city pollution by cutting down on car use, aiding environmental efforts against climate change. Cities like New York are incorporating these principles into their urban planning policies to promote healthier lifestyles and environmental sustainability. Studies support the idea that features such as accessible stairs, attractive walking paths, and bike lanes not only make physical activity more appealing but are effective in transforming urban areas into healthier, greener spaces. We were inspired from those findings and would like to know more in the relationship between sidewalk areas and people's choice on commuting ways.

# **Initial Questions**
We were interested in exploring the availability of sidewalk areas and the percentage of walking among commuters influence obesity rates across different boroughs and neighborhoods.
The purposes of this project is to answer the following questions:

- What are the most popular commuting methods in different boroughs?  
- Which area (by borough) has the highest obesity rate?  
- What is the association between sidewalk areas and the percentage of walking among commuters by boroughs?  
- How does the availability of sidewalk areas and the percentage of walking among commuters influence obesity rates across different boroughs?  


# **Data Sources and Cleaning**
Due to the limitations of the variables and information within the dataset, the data cleaning process was conducted independently for each analysis part.

## Part 1.

## Part 2.
The difference in obesity rates between the Bronx and Manhattan from 2003 to 2022 might relate to the presence of sidewalks. Manhattan, with its abundance of well-maintained sidewalks, encourages walking and active lifestyles, likely contributing to its lower obesity rates. In contrast, fewer and poorly maintained sidewalks in the Bronx may limit physical activity opportunities for residents, possibly leading to higher obesity rates. Enhancing sidewalk infrastructure in the Bronx could promote more physical activity and help reduce these rates.

# **Model Building**

## Key Indicators
### **1. Association Between Sidewalk Areas and Walking Among Commuters**
Linear regression revealed a significant positive relationship between sidewalk area percentage and walking commuter rates. For every 1% increase in sidewalk coverage, walking commuter rates increased by approximately 1.96 percentage points. This finding underscores the importance of pedestrian infrastructure in promoting walking as a mode of transportation.

### **2. Interaction Between Sidewalk Area and Walking on Obesity Rates**
An interaction model was constructed to determine if the relationship between sidewalk area percentage and obesity rates depended on walking commuter rates. The results showed no significant interaction effect (p = 0.932), indicating that the effects of sidewalk area and walking commuter rates on obesity operate independently. Neither sidewalk area (p = 0.556) nor walking commuter rates (p = 0.317) had significant direct effects on obesity rates in this model.

### **3. Causal Mediation Analysis**
Mediation analysis demonstrated that walking commuter rates significantly mediated the relationship between sidewalk area percentage and obesity rates. Our key results are:
- **Indirect Effect (ACME):** A statistically significant reduction in obesity rates of 0.91 units for every 1% increase in sidewalk area, mediated by walking commuter rates (p < 0.001).
- **Direct Effect (ADE):** No statistically significant direct effect of sidewalk area on obesity rates (-0.631, p = 0.124).
- **Total Effect:** A significant total reduction of 1.54 units in obesity rates for every 1% increase in sidewalk area (p < 0.001).
- **Proportion Mediated:** Approximately 59% of the total effect was mediated by walking behavior.


# **Conclusion**

This project highlights the importance of urban active design, such as the sidewalk infrastructure in promoting walking and improving public health outcomes. Walking commuter rates are a critical pathway linking sidewalk availability to reduced obesity rates, as shown by the significant mediation effects. While sidewalk area alone does not directly influence obesity rates, its ability to foster walking behavior plays a pivotal role in reducing obesity.



# **Discussion**

The findings emphasize the need for integrated urban planning strategies that combine pedestrian-friendly infrastructure with initiatives to encourage active commuting behaviors. Policymakers should prioritize investments in sidewalk improvements, particularly in areas with high obesity rates, such as the Bronx, to promote healthier lifestyles. Future research could explore additional mediators, such as access to recreational spaces or socioeconomic factors, to gain a deeper understanding of how urban infrastructure influences health outcomes.

This project provides actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers aiming to reduce obesity rates through infrastructure and behavior change interventions. By promoting walking as a commuting mode, cities can achieve both public health and environmental sustainability goals.
