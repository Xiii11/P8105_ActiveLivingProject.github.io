<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>We utilized <a
href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/walking-driving-and-cycling/?id=2415#display=summary">Walking,
driving, and cycling</a> and <a
href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/overweight/?id=2061#display=summary">Overweight</a>
from The Official Website of the City of New York.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/walking-driving-and-cycling/?id=2415#display=summary">Walking,
driving, and cycling</a> dataset covers various commuting modes used by
<code>adults</code>, focusing on public transit, biking, walking, and
driving using private vehicles. This information provides insights into
transportation availability and choices.The dataset provides aggregated
data for overlapping four-year intervals, starting from 2007 and
extending to 2021. Each interval represents a rolling four-year period.
We use the latest 2017-2021 dataset to do data analysis.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/overweight/?id=2061#display=summary">Overweight</a>
provides insights into the prevalence of
<code>overweight or obesity</code> among adults across New York City.
The data spans from 2003 to 2022, with yearly updates available. It
offers granular breakdowns by geographical boundaries including
citywide, borough, and UHF34 regions. The dataset includes key metrics
such as the number of individuals classified as overweight or obese and
the percentage prevalence.</p>

<h2><strong>Data Import and Tidy</strong></h2>
<div id="part-1-major-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Part 1: Major Datasets</em></h3>
<p>Firstly, we processed both
<code>neighborhood- and borough-level</code> commuting data, focusing on
four commuting methods: bicycle, car/truck/van, public transportation,
and walking. These methods are represented in terms of both absolute
numbers and percentages. We clean the dataset by removing unnecessary
columns, renaming variables for clarity (e.g., <code>geography</code>
renamed to <code>neighborhood</code> and <code>borough</code>
accordingly based on analysis needs), and converting numeric data from
character format to ensure proper analysis.</p>
<p>Next, we pivot the data into a long format, enabling a flexible
structure for analysis and visualization by method and borough. The
dataset is sorted by <code>geo_id</code> for a consistent ordering of
boroughs. This preparation provides a clean and organized dataset that
supports further exploratory analysis of commuting patterns and their
relationships to sidewalk and obesity factors.</p>
<p>The final dataset <code>commuting_data</code> showed below.</p>

<p>We proceed to import our data using both read.csv() and read_csv()
from the readr package, specifying NA values to accurately handle
missing data right from the start. We then standardize column names to a
uniform format with janitor::clean_names() function, which simplifies
further coding and analysis. Moreover,we also transform the data by
converting numeric fields from string format to actual numbers, removing
commas for accurate calculations, and filtering the dataset to include
only borough-level data</p>
<p>Similarly, for overweight &amp; obesity dataset, we first create a
bar chart using ggplot2 to display obesity rates and corresponding
numbers for each NYC borough, enhancing clarity with direct textual
annotations on the bars. To make the chart interactive and allow dynamic
exploration, we employ plotly, transforming the static ggplot into an
interactive visualization. Additionally, we develop a trend line plot to
illustrate changes in obesity rates over the years across boroughs. This
line plot, also made interactive with plotly, includes tooltips that
provide detailed data insights when users hover over any point, thus
enabling a deeper understanding of obesity trends within each
borough.</p>
<p>The final dataset <code>obesity_data</code> showed below.</p>
