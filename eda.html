<p>The presented dataset examines the distribution of
<code>Sidewalk Area</code> across different <code>Neighborhoods</code>,
represented as a percentage of the total land area. The data ranges from
a minimum of approximately 2.7% to a maximum of over 11.3% . The
interquartile range, which captures the middle 50% of the data, lies
between approximately 6.2% and 9.525%, with the median percentage at
7.65%.</p>
<p>The distribution shows considerable variation in sidewalk coverage,
which could be significant for studying how built environment features
influence transportation choices and public health outcomes. This
baseline understanding of sidewalk distribution will be valuable for
examining potential correlations with commuting patterns and obesity
rates across neighborhoods.</p>

<p>This chart provides an overview of commuting patterns across
neighborhoods, categorized by <code>Commute Mode</code>—bicycle,
car/truck/van, public transportation, and walking—and represented by
their <code>Neighborhood (Geo ID)</code>. Public transportation
(<strong><span
style="color:darkolivegreen;">darkolivegreen</span></strong>) is the
predominant mode in most neighborhoods, while walking (<strong><span
style="color:thistle;">thistle</span></strong>) varies widely, likely
reflecting differences in walkability and urban infrastructure. Bicycle
commuting (<strong><span
style="color:lightpink;">lightpink</span></strong>) is minimal across
all areas, and reliance on car/truck/van (<strong><span
style="color:gold;">gold</span></strong>) shows variability, potentially
indicating disparities in access to alternative modes of transit like
public transportation. The chart effectively highlights commuting
behaviors, though adding specific indicators or overlays to visualize
sidewalk coverage would strengthen the analysis of its influence on
transportation choices.</p>

<p>This chart highlights the relationship between obesity trends and
potential influences of sidewalk coverage and commute modes across
neighborhoods from 2014 to 2022. Neighborhoods with higher obesity
percentages, such as parts of the Bronx and Staten Island, might reflect
areas with lower walkability or limited alternative commute options like
walking or cycling, possibly due to less extensive sidewalk
infrastructure or greater reliance on car/truck transportation.
Conversely, neighborhoods like Manhattan, with consistently lower
obesity percentages, likely benefit from higher walkability, robust
public transportation systems, and better sidewalk coverage, encouraging
active commuting. The data underscores the importance of urban design
and accessible sidewalks in promoting healthier commuting behaviors and
reducing obesity disparities across neighborhoods.</p>

<p>This visualization compares the relationship between sidewalk
coverage and obesity percentages in 2014 and 2022. In 2014, there is a
less consistent association, with obesity percentages showing minimal
variation across different levels of sidewalk coverage. Conversely, in
2022, a more distinct trend emerges, suggesting a stronger negative
relationship between sidewalk coverage and obesity percentages,
particularly at higher levels of sidewalk coverage. This shift may
reflect increased effectiveness of urban infrastructure or public health
initiatives over time. However, outliers and variability in both years
highlight the need for further exploration into neighborhood-specific
factors influencing these dynamics.</p>
